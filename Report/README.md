# The time complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithms implemented for finding the fastest, cheapest, and best paths between two cities can be analyzed based on the operations performed within the algorithms. We will consider the number of cities (vertices) as `V` and the number of roads (edges) as `E`.


### Fastest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
The `findFastestPath` method uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which has a time complexity of `O(V log V + E)` when using a binary heap (priority queue). Here's the breakdown:
- Each city is added to the priority queue once, and the `poll()` operation takes `O(log V)` time. Since we do this for all `V` cities, this part contributes `O(V log V)`.
- For each road, we perform a `decrease-key` operation on the priority queue, which also takes `O(log V)` time. Since we do this for all `E` roads, this part contributes `O(E log V)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity for the `findFastestPath` method is `O(V log V + E log V)`, which simplifies to `O((V + E) log V)`.

### Cheapest Path
The `findCheapestPath` method is similar to the `findFastestPath` method, except it minimizes cost instead of time. The time complexity remains the same: `O((V + E) log V)`.

### Best Path
The `findBestPath` method, as implemented with the combined cost metric (sum of time and cost), is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm but with a modified cost function. The time complexity is also `O((V + E) log V)`.

However, it's important to note that the `findBestPath` method's complexity can vary depending on the specific implementation details and how the "best" path is defined. If the scoring function is more complex or if additional constraints are added, the complexity could increase.

### Conclusion
For all three methods (`findFastestPath`, `findCheapestPath`, and `findBestPath`), the time complexity is `O((V + E) log V)` under the assumption that a binary heap (priority queue) is used and that the graph is connected (i.e., there is a path between any two cities).

In the worst case, where every city is connected to every other city, `E` could be as large as `V(V - 1)/2` (for a complete graph), and the time complexity would be dominated by `E`, leading to `O(V^2 log V)`. However, in practical road networks, `E` is typically much less than `V^2`, and the time complexity is closer to `O(V log V)`.

Keep in mind that the actual performance can also be influenced by factors such as the implementation of the priority queue, the structure of the road network, and the distribution of road costs and times.
